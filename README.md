# Customer-Admin-Portal

Customer Admin Portal is a platform where administrators of any organisation have access. Administrators can perform tasks such as Add Customer, Delete Customer and fetch all the customer details available in the database. For frontend I used HTML, CSS. For backend I used Java, Servelets, MySQL, JSP.
